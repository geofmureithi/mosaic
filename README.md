⚠️ Work in Progress & Security Notice

Mosaic is currently work in progress and has not been audited.
Due to the lack of a security audit and the evolving nature of the codebase, it is strongly recommended not to use mainnet.

Use only for development, testing, or experimental purposes until a stable release.
